====1. Linux file management===

A) Listing Files:
    commands:
    a) $ls  
    b) $ls -l 

B) Metacharacters

    Metacharacters have a special meaning in Unix. For example, * and ? are metacharacters.
    We use * to match 0 or more characters, a question mark (?) matches with a single character.

    commands:
    a) $ls ch*.doc  => search for file that starts with ch and end with .doc
       eg. ls images/ed*.jpg
    b) ls -a => show hidden files 
        eg. ls -l -a => show hidden files and list in vertical format

C) Creating Files
    
    You can use the vi editor to create ordinary files on any Unix system. 
    command: 

    $ vi filename

    note: if a file exits 'vi filename' will open it in edit mode

D) Display content of a file

    $cat filename 

    eg. cat -b index.html => -b option shows line number in cat command 

E) Counting Words in a File

    $wc filename
    eg wc index.html
    output:268  749 9958 index.html
    Here, first is line number, second number of words, third no. of bytes in the file, fourth file name

F) Copying Files 
    To make a copy of a file use the cp command. 
    command:
    $ cp source_file destination_file
    eg. cp index.html /home/Olebhoj/Desktop/

G) Renaming Files
    
    To change the name of a file, use the mv command. Following is the basic syntax −
    command: 
    $ mv old_file new_file
        eg. mv index.html nishant.html

H)Deleting Files

    To delete an existing file, use the rm command. Following is the basic syntax −
    command:
    $ rm filename
        eg. rm -rf index.html =>  rm -rf = remove refactor command



=============2. Linux directories====================

A) Home directory
    $cd ~
B) absolute path
    eg. /etc/passwd/
C) Current working directory
    $ pwd 

D) Creating Directories
    $ mkdir dirname

    #creating parent directory
    $ mkdir -p /tmp/bhoj/test => -p creates all the necesary parent directory temp >bhoj>test
        eg. mkdir -p ./tmp/bhoj/test => creates directories in parent directories\

E) Removing directories
    $ rmdir dirname

F) Renaming directory
    $ mv olddir newdir

G) The directories . (dot) and .. (dot dot)

    The filename . (dot) represents the current working directory; and the filename .. (dot dot) represents 
    the directory one level above the current working directory, often referred to as the parent directory.

=============3. File access permission=======================

A) The Permission Indicators 
    $ ls -l 
    eg output : drwxrwxr-x 20 olebhoj olebhoj  4096 Aug  2 09:45 Folder 
    => drwxrwxr = owner has delete ,read, writ, execute permission ,-x only execute command to the group it belongs to

B) Changing Permissions
    To change the file or the directory permissions, you use the chmod (change mode) command
    eg. chmod 777 nishant.html => 777 means all permission

    Permission tables
    Number 	Octal Permission Representation 	                        Ref
        0 	No permission 	                                            ---
        1 	Execute permission 	                                        --x
        2 	Write permission 	                                        -w-
        3 	Execute and write permission: 1 (execute) + 2 (write) = 3 	-wx
        4 	Read permission 	                                        r--
        5 	Read and execute permission: 4 (read) + 1 (execute) = 5 	r-x
        6 	Read and write permission: 4 (read) + 2 (write) = 6 	    rw-
        7 	All permissions: 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) = 7 	rwx


    other examples
    $ chmod 755 filename
    $ chmod 043 filename_or_directoryname

C) Changing Owners and Groups 

    -Changing Ownership 
    $ chown user filelist  => eg. chown Olebhoj testfile

    -Changing Group Ownership
    $ chgrp group filelist
