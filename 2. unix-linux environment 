==========Unix/Linux environment===============

A)Printing Files 
    i)The pr Command:
        pr: The pr command does minor formatting of files on the terminal screen or for a printer. 
        For example, if you have a long list of names in a file, you can format it onscreen into two or more columns.
    command :
    $ pr option(s) filename(s)
    
    options:
    -k => Produces k columns of output,
    -d => Double-spaces the output (not on all pr versions),
    -h "header" => Takes the next item as a report header, etc
    
    ii) The lpstat and lpq Commands

    The lpstat command shows what's in the printer queue: request IDs, owners, file sizes, when the
    jobs were sent for printing, and the status of the requests.

    Use lpstat -o if you want to see all output requests other than just your own. Requests are shown in 
    the order they'll be printed 

    iii) The cancel and lprm Commands

    The cancel command terminates a printing request from the lp command. The lprm command terminates all lpr requests.
    You can specify either the ID of the request (displayed by lp or lpq) or the name of the printer.

B) Sending Email
    Note: to use mail you need to install mailutils : sudo apt install mailutils
    You use the Unix mail command to send and receive mail. Here is the syntax to send an email −

    $mail [-s subject] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc-addr] to-addr

    -s => Specifies subject on the command line.
    -c => Sends carbon copies to the list of users.
    -b => Sends blind carbon copies to list.

    e.g $mail -s "Test Message" admin@gmail.com

    Then you are expected to type your email message.

    Hi

    I am bhoj. This is a test mail

    ....

==========Unix/Linux -Pipes and Filters=================

A) The grep Command
    The grep command searches a file or files for lines that have a certain pattern. 
    command syntax:
    $grep pattern file(s)
    eg. ls -l | grep "Aug"

    options in grep command:
    eg. ...|grep option(s) "Filter pattern"
    $ls -l | grep -i "Jul"
    options:
    -i => Matches either upper or lowercase.
    -v => Prints all lines that do not match pattern.
    -c => Prints only the count of matching lines.
    -l => Prints only the names of files with matching lines (letter "l")
    -n => Prints the matched line and its line number.

==========Unix / Linux - Processes Management==============

A) Listing Running Processes
    $ps => list process 
    $ps -f => list process -f means full shows more list 

B) Stoping the process
    $kill processID
    Note: 
    the kill command terminates the first_one process. If a process ignores a regular kill 
    command, you can use kill -9 followed by the process ID as follows −

    $kill -9 6738
    Terminated

    #Parent and Child Processes
    --------------------------

    Each unix process has two ID numbers assigned to it: The Process ID (pid) and the Parent process ID (ppid).

    #Zombie and Orphan Processes
    ---------------------------

    Normally, when a child process is killed, the parent process is updated via a SIGCHLD signal. 
    Then the parent can do some other task or restart a new child as needed. However, sometimes the parent 
    process is killed before its child is killed. In this case, the "parent of all processes," the init 
    process, becomes the new PPID (parent process ID). In some cases, these processes are called orphan processes.

    #Daemon Processes
    ------------------

    Daemons are system-related background processes that often run with the permissions of
    root and services requests from other processes.

    A daemon has no controlling terminal. It cannot open /dev/tty. If you do
    a "ps -ef" and look at the tty field, all daemons will have a ? for the tty.

    #The top Command

    The top command is a very useful tool for quickly showing processes sorted by various criteria.
    command:
    $top
