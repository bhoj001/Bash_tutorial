============Unix / Linux - Using Shell Arrays============

    A) array operations
    array syntax
    array_name[index]=value

    As an example, the following commands −

    NAME[0]="Zara"
    NAME[1]="Qadir"
    NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
    NAME[3]="Ayan"
    NAME[4]="Daisy"

    Accessing Array Values

    After you have set any array variable, you access it as follows −
    ${array_name[index]}

==========Unix / Linux - Shell Basic Operators==================

There are various operators supported by each shell. We will discuss in detail about Bourne shell (default shell) in this chapter.

We will now discuss the following operators −

    Arithmetic Operators
    Relational Operators
    Boolean Operators
    String Operators
    File Test Operators

    eg.
    #!/bin/sh

    val=`expr 2 + 2`
    echo "Total value : $val"


========Unix / Linux - Shell Decision Making============

    Unix Shell supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on 
    different conditions. We will now understand two decision-making statements here −

        The if...else statement

        The case...esac statement


        if...fi statement
        if...else...fi statement
        if...elif...else...fi statement


        Note: The case...esac statement in the Unix shell is very similar to the switch...case statement 
        we have in other programming languages like C or C++ and PERL, etc.

===========Unix / Linux - Shell Loop Types===============


    The while loop
    The for loop
    The until loop
    The select loop
